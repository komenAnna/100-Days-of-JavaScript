    - [x] The Document Object Model (DOM) --> difference between 'querySelector' &  'querySelectorAll', 'eventListener'
    - [x] CSS styling
    - [x] Bootstrap classes -- buttons in bootstrap
    - [x] Javascript Anonymous Immediately Invoked functions --
        - [x] An Anonymous function is a function without a name
        - [x] An Anonymous function should be placed insie the () of you'll get a syntax error. 
        - [x] The () makes the anonymous function an expression that returns a function object.
        - [x] An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation. Therefore, you often need to assign it to a variable if you want to call it later
        - [x] You can also use them as arguments eg line 6--script.js in the foreach(anonymous function) method
        - [x] Adding a paranthesis at the end makes it an Immediately Invoked function -- you can pass arguments in the ()
    - [x] ClassList.contains() method to find a specific class or ID from the HTML -- varName.classList.contains("./#")

    - [x] CSS styling -- Margin, Buttons, Padding, Top, Right, Flexbox(display, align-items, justify-content, height to center elements on a page), 
    - [x] CSS positioning, flex property to fit item in div
    - [x] Javascript functions --> Calling a function as an argument
    - [x] innerText property sets the text from the JS to HTML --> set the textLength variable in the counter element --> counter.innerText = `${textLength}` sets the text length in HTML element held in the counter var
    - [x] value property retrieves or sets the text in the entry field of the textArea element --> textarea.value takes the value in the text area
    - [x] length property returns the length of the string object --> text.length 
## Day 8
- Built an Image Slider page and got to learn:
    - [x] The Document Object Model (DOM) --> 'querySelectorAll' to select all instances of that classname and 'querySelector' which selects only the first instance of that classname, 'addEventListener'
    - [x] CSS styling -- Margin, Buttons, Padding, Flexbox(display, align-items, justify-content, height to center elements on a page), 
    - [x] CSS positioning --> 5 types: relative, absolute, static, fixed, sticky
    - [x] Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. 
        - [x] Relative - element is positioned relative(with reference to) to its normal position.
        - [x] Absolute - element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
        - [x] Fixed - element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
        - [x] Static - elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
        - [x] Sticky - is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
    - [x] Javascript functions --> Immediately Invoked Anonymous Function
    - [x] ClassList.contains() method to find a specific class or ID from the HTML -- varName.classList.contains("./#") -->
    - [x] Adding styling properties from the JS file --> var.style.propertyName = "property"
## Day 9
- Built an Analog Clock page that displays the currrent time and got to learn:
    - [x] The Document Object Model (DOM) -->'querySelector' which selects only the first instance of that classname, 'addEventListener' that listens for any prompt from an element
    - [x] CSS styling -- Margin, Padding, Flexbox(display, align-items, justify-content, height to center elements on a page), 
    - [x] CSS positioning --> Absolute
        - [x] Absolute - element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
    - [x] CSS ::after, ::before -->
        -[x] :: after -- inserts something after the content of each selected element(s). The content property specifies the content to insert.
        - [x] :: before --  inserts something before the content of each selected element(s). The content property specifies the content to insert.
    - [x] Javascript setInterval() method -->
        - [x] Window setInterval() method calls a function at specified intervals in milliseconds it continues calling the function until clearInterval is called , or the window is closed
        - [x] Syntax : setInterval(function(), milliseconds)
    - [x] Javascript Date() method -->
        -[x] Date() -- allow you to get and set the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond
        -[x] getHours() -- returns the hour (0 to 23) of a date. eg At time of this code, the return is 2
        -[x] getMinutes() -- returns the minutes (0 to 59) of a date. eg At time of coding, the return is 02
        -[x] getSeconds() -- returns the seconds (0 to 59) of a date. eg At the time of coding, the return is 36
    - [x] Adding styling properties from the JS file --> var.style.propertyName = "property" --> var.style.transform = "rotateZ()"
    -[x] RotateZ() --> rotates an element around its z-axix at a given degree
## Day 10

## Day 11

## Day 12

## Day 13
- Built a page that displays the current day and a corresponding quote and got to learn:
    - [x] The Document Object Model (DOM) --> 'getElementById' to select an element using its 'id'
    - [x] CSS styling -- Flexbox(display, align-items, justify-content, height, width to center elements on a page), text-transform (to uppercase) 
    - [x] Javascript DATE() functions --> 
        - [x] Date() -- The Date object works with dates and times. Date objects are created with new Date().
        - [x] Date.getDay() -- method returns the day of the week (0 to 6) of a date. Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, ... 
        - [x] Date.getDate() -- method returns the day of the month (1 to 31) of a date.
    - [x] Switch case -->
        - [x] Is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
        - [x] Selects one of many codeblocks to be executed
        - [x] The switch expression is evaluated once.
        - [x] The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
        - [x] If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
        - [x] If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
    - [x] var.innerHTML -- this property sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element. In this case, we set the value of 'theDayIs' and 'quote' object to the span#weekday and span#quote element from the JS file.
## Day 14
- Built a page that displays a countdown timer:
    - [x] Incomplete JS
## Day 15
- Built a page that displays an Add-To-Cart Animation:
    - [x] HTML data-* attribute:
        - [x] The data-* attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application.
        - [x] The data-* attribute gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.
        - [x] The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).
        - [x] The data-* attribute consist of two parts:
            - [x] The attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix "data-" in this case the data attribute is "data-totalitems".
            - [x] The attribute value can be any string.
        - [x] The data-* attribute is a Global Attribute, and can be used on any HTML element.
    - [x] CSS styling:
        - [x] Flexbox(display, align-items, justify-content, height, width to center elements on a page)
        - [x] Positioning:
            - [x] Absolute - element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
            - [x] Relative - element is positioned relative(with reference to) to its normal position.
        - [x] @keyframes -- used for animations. It gives you more control over the animation you want to perform. The animation is created by gradually changing from one style to another. You can change the CSS styles as many times as you want.
            - [x] Specify when the style change will happen in %, or with the keywords "from" and "to", which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.
        - [x] Translate() -- moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).
    - [x] JQUERY --- is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library:
        - [x] The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
        - [x] page can't be manipulated safely until the document is "ready." jQuery detects this state of readiness for you.
        - [x] JQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s):
            - [x] $(selector).action()
            - [x] A $ sign to define/access jQuery
            - [x] A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
            - [x] A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
            - [x] Examples:
                - [x] $(this).hide() - hides the current element.
                - [x] $("p").hide() - hides all paragraph elements.
                - [x] $(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".
                - [x] $("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".
        - [x] The Document Ready Event
            - [x] This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).
            - [x] Code included inside $( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready for JavaScript code to execute
            - [x] Syntax: 
                $(document).ready(function(){
                    // jQuery methods go here...
                });
        - [x] [JQuery Selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp)
        - [x] [JQuery Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_events.asp)
            - [x] click(), dbclick(), mouseenter(), mouseleave() etc
            - [x] The on() method -- attaches one or more event handlers for the selected elements.
        - [x] [JQuery Add Class](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_css_classes.asp)
        - [x] [JQuery Remove Class](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_css_classes.asp)
    - [x] SetTimeOut() --- method calls a function after a number of milliseconds. 1 second = 1000 milliseconds.
## Day 16
- Built a page that includes a form that takes a message as input and displays it:
    - [x] CSS Styling:
        - [x] Box-sizing -- allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
        If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height
        - [x] Flexbox -- display, align-items, justify-comtent, min-height
    - [x] JavaScript:
        - [x] Immediately-invoked Function Expression (IIFE) -  is a technique to execute a Javascript function as soon as they are created. Are also called anonymous functions as they have no defined names.
        - [x] Form e.preventDefault() -- this method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur.
        - [x] SetTimeOut() -- method calls a function after a number of milliseconds. 1 second = 1000 milliseconds.
        - [x] [classList](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp) property --  property returns the CSS classnames of an element.
        - [x] [textContent](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_textcontent.asp) property -- property sets or returns the text content of the specified node, and all its descendants.
## Day 17
- Built a page that displays a functioning calculator and got to learn:
    - [x] The Document Object Model (DOM) --> 
        - [x] The 'querySelecor' method returns an array-like object called a node list. These data structures are referred to as “Array-like”, because they appear as an array, but can not be used with array methods like map and forEach.
        - [x] Trying to call the Array.forEach method on the array-like object causes the error "TypeError 'forEach' is not a function in JavaScript"
        - [x] To convert the 'node list' into an array, we use the Array.from(nodelist) or Array.apply(null, nodelist) methods
        - [x] This also applies to tElementsBy* (getElementsByTagName,getElementsByClassName, etc)
        - [x] f you need to iterate them using forEach, then create an array by copying the collection using Array.from
    - [x] CSS styling -- Flexbox(display, align-items, justify-content, height, width to center elements on a page)
    - [x] Javascript EVAL() function --> 
        - [x] The eval() method evaluates or executes an argument.
        - [x] If the argument is an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. 
        - [x] If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, eval() executes the statements.
